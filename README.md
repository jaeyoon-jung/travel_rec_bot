# Twitterbot - JetSetR - @travel_rec

# This GITHUB repo contains the code for out twitterbot.

# Functionality 1:
# Automated random selection of a city from a pre-sorted database.
# City is input into Tripadvisor website and then code retrieves:
# Top 3 things to do in that city and 4 options on where to stay.

#Things to do places are input into Flickr and image is retrieved.

# Three different types of tweets are randomly generated.

# Due to 140 character limit, suggestions are given in a series of tweets.
# 1st tweet is the suggestion, 2nd tweet is location on world map & 3rd-5th tweet is pics of things to do.
# Code also functions to plot city on world map..

# Functionality 2:
# If the bot is tweeted at using handle with a city name, it will do the above following, even if city
# is not in the database as the links are dynamic.
